```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b; }
```

🔍 **Issues:**
* ❌ **Undeclared Variables:** The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope or passed as
arguments. This will lead to a `ReferenceError` when the function is executed.
* ❌ **Poor Function Signature:** A `sum` function should ideally accept the numbers it needs to sum as parameters for
reusability and clarity. Relying on global variables makes the function less predictable and harder to maintain.

✅ **Recommended Fix:**

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 **Improvements:**
* ✔ **Clear Parameters:** The function now explicitly takes `a` and `b` as parameters, making its inputs clear and
preventing `ReferenceError`.
* ✔ **Reusability:** The function can now be used to sum any two numbers without relying on external variable
declarations.
* ✔ **Readability & Maintainability:** It's immediately clear what the function expects and what it does.
* ✔ **Documentation:** Added a JSDoc block to explain the function's purpose, parameters, and return value, improving
future maintainability.

**Final Note:**
Always define your function's inputs explicitly through parameters. This makes your code more robust, testable, and
easier for others (and your future self!) to understand and use. Consider adding unit tests for such utility functions,
e.g., `sum(2, 3)` should return `5`.
